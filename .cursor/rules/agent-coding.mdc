# Agent Coding Conventions

## Git Commits

Use conventional commits for all changes:

- `feat(<scope>): <description>` -- new functionality
- `fix(<scope>): <description>` -- bug fixes
- `refactor(<scope>): <description>` -- code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs(<scope>): <description>` -- documentation only
- `test(<scope>): <description>` -- adding or updating tests
- `chore(<scope>): <description>` -- build, deps, config changes

Scope is optional but preferred (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT token validation`).

Each commit must be:
- **Atomic**: one logical change per commit
- **Buildable**: the project compiles/runs after this commit
- **Tested**: relevant tests pass after this commit

Commit messages explain *why*, not just *what*. The diff shows what changed; the message explains the reasoning.

## Pull Requests

- One logical change per PR
- Keep PRs small and reviewable (under 15 minutes to review)
- PR title matches the primary commit type (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT authentication`)
- PR body includes: summary of changes, motivation, and test plan

## Code Quality

- Run the project's test suite before committing
- Run the project's linter/formatter before committing
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens
- Do not commit generated files, build artifacts, or dependency directories
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the project

## Task Completion

When a task is complete:
1. Ensure all changes are committed with proper conventional commit messages
2. Verify tests pass
3. Summarize what was changed and what to test manually (if applicable)
